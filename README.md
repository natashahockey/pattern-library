# My Pattern Library

The purpose of this pattern library is to showcase and display the components used in a portfolio website. These components have been browser tested and performance checked in order to make the code base as high quality as possible.

Documentation has also been provided for each component so that its usage and description is known by all developers involved in the project. A single component view has been created so that developers can create a shareable URL to specific components.

## Navigation http://natashahockey.github.io/pattern-library/navigation.html

The navigation component holds the main nav items required for navigation a website. The number of nav items can be increased / decreased depending on the website. This allows for flexibility and scalability.

## Buttons

Buttons can be used for a variety of different actions and they can be styled differently depending on the action. This pattern library holds 6 different button types.

### Default Button

A defaul button can be used for a generic call to action. This could be linking to another page within the website.

### Ghost Button

A ghost button can be paired with a default button if there are two actions that could take place in an instance. The ghost and default buttons are the same size they are just styled differently.


### Icon Button

An icon button can be used to help users understand the action they are about to take. An example would be a download icon paired with the word download. It helps users understand what is going to happen as a result of clicking the button.



### Dropdown Button

A dropdown button can be used when the user has the option to select from 1 or more items in a list. This is a good way of keeping content organised.
